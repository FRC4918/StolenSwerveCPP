General coding:
- Create swerveModule SDS-wheel travel, so that I can convert rotations to inches.
- Use odometry object.
- check order of events in switch statement.
- Double-check CANCoder settings.
- Do TalonFX Drive settings.
- Do TalonFX Turn settings.
- Add more unit types?
- Should there be a difference between kChassisMaxSpeed and kModuleMaxSpeed?
- Double check inversion with controller.
- Add code to zero CANcoder.
- Something is wrong with the way I am passing the turn information. (99% sure)

Administrative:
- Put SwerveModule code in its own folder.
- Get rid of std::cout and <iostream> per Adam.
- Get rid of as many "using namespace" as possible.
- Rename constants as kConstantNameHere.
- Make sure all functions are capitalized.
- Add comments everywhere.
- Read style guide.
- Optimize units?
- -wreorder warning

With physical robot:
- Check if CANCoder needs to be inverted.
- Tune PID for Drive.
- Tune PID for Turn.
- Get final module locations.
