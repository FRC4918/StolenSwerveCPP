General coding:
- Create odometry object.
- check order of events in switch statement.
- Double-check CANCoder settings.
- Do TalonFX Drive settings.
- Do TalonFX Turn settings.
- Set Falcon velocity from code.
- Set Falcon angle target from code.
- Tie joystick into Drive command (which uses SwerveDrive() from subsystem and maxVelocity).
- Add max-module speed (in drivetrain.cpp).

Administrative:
- Put SwerveModule code in its own folder.
- Get rid of std::cout and <iostream> per Adam.
- Rename constants as kConstantNameHere.
- Make sure all functions are capitalized.
- Add comments everywhere.
- Read style guide.
- Optimize units?

With physical robot:
- Check if CANCoder needs to be inverted.
- Tune PID for Drive.
- Tune PID for Turn.
- Get final module locations.
